      <p>
        Multirotor drones, such as quadcopters, have motors (generally 4, 6, or 8) that generate the thrust needed for flight. There are two main types of motors used in drones: <br>
        - <b>Brushless Motors:</b> Offer greater efficiency and durability. <br>
        - <b>Brushed Motors:</b> More affordable but less efficient and durable. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        1 - E310 TUNED PROPULSION SYSTEM - <b>$209.99</b>
        The E310 package features newly upgraded motors, propellers, and ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers). With the transition from a traditional square-wave drive system to a revolutionary sine-wave drive system, the innovations packed into the E310 Motor Package make it our most efficient, maneuverable, and stable multi-rotor platform to date. <br>
        
        <b>Package Contents:</b> <br>
